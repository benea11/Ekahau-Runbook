# Ekahau-Runbook

The Ekahau Runbook script was created to aid in project tracking, especially when dealing with 3rd party cabling vendor.
The script will extract AP, Antenna, and Location details from the ekahau project file and place them in a CSV.
The file is then completed with additional details which are completed during the delivery of the project, and later used for documentation purposes.
